    summary: |
      I was born in Treviglio in 2001 and have always been a creative and inventive individual.
      My passion for electronics and computer science led me to attend the Scientific Lyceum at
      the Istituto Facchetti. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at the
      University of Pavia. I am known for being detail-oriented and rigorous, while also possessing
      strong adaptability skills. I thrive on challenges, continually seeking more difficult ones
      to learn new things and expand my skill set.
