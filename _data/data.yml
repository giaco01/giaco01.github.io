career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I was born in Italy in 2001 and have always been a creative and inventive individual.
      My passion for electronics and computer science led me to attend the Scientific Lyceum
      at the Istituto Facchetti. In 2024 I earned a degree in Computer Engineering from the
      University of Pavia. Currently I am pursuing a degree in Mechatronics Engineering at
      the Politecnico di Torino. Known for being detail-oriented and rigorous, I also have
      strong adaptability skills. I thrive on challenges, continually seeking new ones to
      expand my skills and knowledge.
