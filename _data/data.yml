career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I was born in Italy in 2001 and have always been a creative and inventive individual.
      My passion for electronics and computer science led me to attend the Scientific Lyceum
      at the Istituto Facchetti. In 2024 I earned a degree in Computer Engineering from the
      University of Pavia. Currently I am pursuing a degree in Mechatronics Engineering at
      the Politecnico di Torino. Known for being detail-oriented and rigorous, I also have
      strong adaptability skills. I thrive on challenges, continually seeking new ones to
      expand my skills and knowledge.

  assignments:
    - title: Simulation of a Parcel Printing and Sorting System
      link: "#"
      tagline: >
        Design and implementation of a PLC-controlled automated parcel handling plant using CoDeSys and FluidSim.
        The system performs weighing, stamping, and sorting operations with full HMI integration.
        Developed employing SFC, Ladder Diagram, and Structured Text programming paradigms.

    - title: Automatic Bottle Filling and Sorting System
      link: "#"
      tagline: >
        Development of an automated bottling and sorting plant in Automation Studio.
        The system fills crates with different beverages (Coke, Fanta, Pepsi) and sorts them based on product type,
        showcasing multi-technique PLC programming and real-time 3D visualization.

    - title: DriveSim GUI and Data Management System
      link: "https://rams.unipv.it/"
      tagline: >
        Bachelor’s thesis project: design and development of an interactive GUI and data management module for
        a 3-DOF rehabilitation driving simulator. Built in Unity with C# to enable configurable training
        and exergame-based rehabilitation modes using motion tracking.

    - title: JavaBeats – Music Player Application
      link: "https://github.com/IngSW-unipv/Progetto-B24"
      tagline: >
        Java-based desktop application for audio playback and content management.
        Features user and artist roles, playlist and album creation, and SQL-backed persistence.
        Developed as part of the Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming course.

    - title: Body Fat Percentage Predictor
      link: "#"
      tagline: >
        Data-driven model for predicting body fat percentage using convolutional regression techniques in MATLAB.
        Focused on improving estimation accuracy from limited datasets within the Model Identification and Data Analysis course.
